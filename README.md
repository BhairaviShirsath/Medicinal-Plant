# Medicinal Plant Detection System using CNN with Plant Booking Portal  

# Description:  

Ayurvedic medicine is an ancient practice that relies on medicinal plants for treatment. Identifying these plants is crucial, as they differ from other species found in nature. However, recognizing them without proper knowledge can be challenging for the average person.  

This project introduces a novel approach using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify Ayurvedic medicinal plants based on leaf images. Advances in computer vision have enabled more accurate image classification, surpassing traditional methods.  

The system covers all essential steps, including image collection, database creation, and model training. Our deep learning approach offers improved classification accuracy and simplifies feature extraction, eliminating the need for preprocessing. Raw image data can be directly fed into the CNN, which captures and processes visual characteristics through multiple layers.  

The solution integrates deep learning and web technologies to enhance user interaction. The web application facilitates plant identification and booking, making the process accessible and efficient.  

# Technologies Used:
